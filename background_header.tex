\section{BACKGROUND}

We will use capital letters to denote either random variables or sets
of random variables. In particular, we will denote the (set of)
protected attribute(s) by $A$, with $A = a$ representing an
assigment according to a vectorized representation of $A$. $X$ will be used
to represent other covariates of interest, while $Y$ is the outcome to
be predicted. We will use $\hat Y$ to denote a prediction, given $A$ and $X$,
for any given data point. $\hat Y$ itself can be random, and a point
prediction can be made based on a summary of this distribution such as its
most probable value (for discrete $\hat Y$) or its expectation (for
continuous $\hat Y$).
